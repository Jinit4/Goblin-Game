I am working on creating the basic game using Python and pygame library.

To install the game

1. Clone the repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Jinit4/Goblin-Game.git

   ```

2. Create a virtual environment

   ````bash
   python -m venv venv #Create a virtual environment named venv and activate it

   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate # For Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate

   ````

3. Installing all the requirements

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

   ```

4. How to run?
   ```bash
   python firstgame.py
   ```
